Fantastic, Mihir! You're now transitioning from Spring Boot monoliths to the world of **Spring Boot Microservices** — a whole new level of backend engineering 🎯

We'll follow the exact same method as before: **Beginner-friendly**, **build-it-yourself**, **concept first**, and **code second**, phase-by-phase.

---

# 🧱 Phase 1: Design & Split Your Monolith

---

## 🎯 Goal

You're no longer writing one big app. You’re **splitting the app into multiple focused services**, each with its **own database**, code, and responsibility.

---

## 🧠 Concept First: What is a Microservice?

A **microservice** is:

* A **small, focused** piece of your overall application
* **Independently deployable**
* Has **its own database** (no cross-service table joins!)
* Communicates with others using **REST**, **messaging**, or **event streaming**

---

## 📦 Step 1: Decide the Boundaries (Domains)

Let’s say you’re building an e-commerce system. You’d typically break it into:

| Service                | Responsibility                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `user-service`         | Manage users, login, registration |
| `product-service`      | Add, update, list products        |
| `order-service`        | Handle customer orders            |
| `notification-service` | Send emails or SMS                |
| `auth-service`         | Handle authentication and JWTs    |

Each service will be an **independent Spring Boot project** (or Maven module in a mono-repo).

---

## 📁 Suggested Folder Structure

If you use separate Git projects:

```
/ecommerce-microservices/
│
├── user-service/
├── product-service/
├── order-service/
├── notification-service/
├── auth-service/
```

Or, in a **monorepo with Maven modules**:

```
/ecommerce-platform/
│
├── pom.xml (parent)
├── user-service/
├── product-service/
├── order-service/
├── notification-service/
├── auth-service/
```

> ✅ Recommendation: Start with a **mono-repo** for simplicity, especially during development.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create the First Service — `user-service`

Let’s create a basic Spring Boot project:

### 📦 1. Generate with Spring Initializr:

* Project: Maven
* Dependencies: `Spring Web`, `Spring Boot DevTools`, `Spring Boot Actuator`, `Spring Data JPA`, `H2`

### 📁 user-service/src/main/java/com/example/userservice/UserServiceApplication.java

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class UserServiceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(UserServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 📁 Basic User Entity, Repository, Controller

#### `User.java`

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String username;
    private String email;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### `UserRepository.java`

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}
```

#### `UserController.java`

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    private final UserRepository repo;

    public UserController(UserRepository repo) {
        this.repo = repo;
    }

    @GetMapping
    public List<User> all() {
        return repo.findAll();
    }

    @PostMapping
    public User create(@RequestBody User user) {
        return repo.save(user);
    }
}
```

#### ✅ application.yml

```yaml
server:
  port: 8081

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:users
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password: ""
  h2:
    console:
      enabled: true
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true
```

---

## ✨ Repeat for `product-service`, `order-service`, etc.

Each service:

* Has its own Spring Boot project
* Owns its **domain model**
* Uses its own **database**

Later, these services will **talk to each other** via HTTP (sync) or Kafka/RabbitMQ (async).

---

## 🔧 Important Rules

* ❌ No shared databases between services
* ✅ Services talk through **network**, not direct method calls
* ✅ Each service is self-contained

---

## ✅ What You’ve Built (So Far)

| Microservice           | Status                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `user-service`         | ✅ REST API                 |
| `product-service`      | 🟡 Similar to user-service |
| `order-service`        | ⏳ Coming                   |
| `notification-service` | ⏳                          |
| `auth-service`         | ⏳                          |

---

## 🧪 Mini-Project (End of Phase 1)

Create:

* A working REST API in `user-service`
* A basic `product-service` with simple product CRUD
* A working directory structure for all services

---

## ✅ Coming Up in Phase 2: Eureka Service Discovery

You’ll:

* Create a Eureka server
* Register all microservices
* Get rid of hardcoded URLs — everything becomes discoverable!

---

Would you like a ready-made Maven mono-repo template I can generate for you (folder + POM + basic services pre-wired)?
If not, we’ll start Phase 2 – Eureka Service Discovery next.
