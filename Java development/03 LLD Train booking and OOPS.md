**IRCTC Ticket Booking App - Backend Development (Low-Level Design)**

---

### **1. Functional Requirements Gathering**
   In order to begin the backend development of the IRCTC Ticket Booking app, it is critical to gather the functional requirements. These requirements define the necessary operations the app should be able to perform.

   **Key Functional Requirements:**
   - **User Authentication:** Users should be able to **sign up** and **log in** using their credentials.
   - **Train Search:** Users should be able to **search for trains** between two stations.
   - **Seat Availability:** After selecting a train, users should be able to **view available seats**.
   - **Ticket Booking:** Once seats are available, users should be able to **book seats**.
   - **Ticket Management:** Users should be able to **fetch** or **download** their booked tickets.

---

### **2. Low-Level Design**
   The low-level design (LLD) focuses on the system's architecture and defines how we can break down the functional requirements into manageable components, such as **entities** and **services**.

   **Entities in the System:**
   - **User Entity:**
     - **Properties**:
       - **Name:** The user's name.
       - **Hashed Password:** Store the password securely using hashing.
       - **UserID:** Unique identifier for the user.
       - **Booked Tickets:** A list of tickets the user has booked.

   - **Ticket Entity:**
     - **Properties**:
       - **TicketID:** A unique identifier for each ticket.
       - **UserID:** The user who owns the ticket.
       - **Source & Destination:** The starting and ending stations.
       - **Travel Date:** Date when the travel is scheduled.
       - **Train ID:** The unique identifier for the train associated with the ticket.

   - **Train Entity:**
     - **Properties**:
       - **TrainID:** Unique identifier for the train.
       - **TrainNumber:** The number of the train.
       - **Departure and Arrival Times:** When the train departs and arrives.
       - **Seats Matrix:** A 2D matrix to represent seat availability (e.g., `0` for unbooked and `1` for booked).

### **3. Implementing Entities**
   Each entity represents a physical world object with associated properties. These entities will be used in the services to handle business logic.

   **Example - User Entity:**
   ```java
   public class User {
       private String userID;
       private String name;
       private String hashedPassword;
       private List<Ticket> bookedTickets;
       
       // Getters and Setters
   }
   ```

   **Example - Ticket Entity:**
   ```java
   public class Ticket {
       private String ticketID;
       private String userID;
       private String source;
       private String destination;
       private LocalDateTime travelDate;
       private String trainID;
       
       // Getters and Setters
   }
   ```

   **Example - Train Entity (with seat availability represented by a matrix):**
   ```java
   public class Train {
       private String trainID;
       private String trainNumber;
       private LocalDateTime departureTime;
       private LocalDateTime arrivalTime;
       private int[][] seatAvailability;  // 2D matrix for seats, 0 for available, 1 for booked
       
       // Getters and Setters
   }
   ```

---

### **4. Service Layer - Business Logic Implementation**
   Services handle the business logic and interactions between entities. For example, we may need a service to book a ticket or search for available trains.

   **User Service:** Manages user-related functionalities like login, signup, and fetching booked tickets.
   ```java
   public class UserService {
       public User login(String username, String password) {
           // Hash password and check against stored data
       }
       
       public void signup(User newUser) {
           // Register a new user and save to database
       }

       public List<Ticket> getBookings(User user) {
           // Fetch all bookings for a specific user
       }
   }
   ```

   **Train Service:** Manages train-related functionalities like searching for trains and fetching seat availability.
   ```java
   public class TrainService {
       public List<Train> searchTrains(String source, String destination) {
           // Return list of trains between source and destination
       }

       public int[][] getAvailableSeats(Train train) {
           // Return the seat availability matrix for the train
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **5. Data Structures for Seat Availability**
   A crucial part of the IRCTC system is managing seat availability for trains. A **2D matrix** is an ideal structure to represent train compartments, where each cell represents a seat.

   **Example Seat Matrix (2D array):**
   ```java
   int[][] seatAvailability = {
       {0, 0, 1},  // First compartment
       {1, 0, 0},  // Second compartment
       {0, 0, 0}   // Third compartment
   };
   ```
   - **0**: Unbooked
   - **1**: Booked

   This data structure allows you to easily check seat availability by referencing the corresponding seat in the matrix.

### **6. Low-Level Design Methodology**
   The low-level design of the app follows certain principles to ensure scalability and maintainability:
   - **Modularization:** Break down large components into smaller, manageable services.
   - **Separation of Concerns:** Keep business logic, data models, and interfaces separated.
   - **Reusability:** Design services and entities that can be reused across different parts of the system.

By following this structured approach, we can implement a robust backend for the IRCTC Ticket Booking app, ensuring it is scalable, maintainable, and able to handle various functionalities efficiently.
